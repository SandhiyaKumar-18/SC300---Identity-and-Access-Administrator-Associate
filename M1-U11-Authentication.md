# 🔑 Explore Authentication

## Overview
Authentication is the process of validating the identity of a user, application, or device to ensure they are who they claim to be. Authentication also ensures an appropriate level of 🛡️ security throughout the authentication transaction.

### Identity Authentication Provides:
- ✅ **Flexible, standards-compliant authentication** that integrates across organizations.
- 🔗 **Integration of disparate sources, applications, and protocols**.
- ⚙️ **Support for multiple industry-standard methods** of validation and assurance.

Using an **identity provider** for authentication ensures secure identities without limiting user capabilities. Benefits include:
- ✨ **Convenience:** Enhances the end-user experience during authentication.
- 🌐 **Multiple identity sources:** Supports federated identity for seamless integration.
- 🔒 **Support for standard authentication protocols:** Ensures secure authentication.
- 👍 **Authentication assurance:** Increases confidence that the user accessing a resource is legitimate.

## 🤝 Federated Identity
Federation refers to a collection of domains that have established trust. This trust typically includes **authentication** and often includes **authorization**. Federation enables organizations to use existing identities from trusted sources, like an **on-premises Active Directory**.

## ⚙️ Common Authentication Protocols
| Protocol | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** | ↔️ Open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider. |
| **WS-Federation (WS-Fed)** | 🔑 Identity specification within the Web Services Security framework that provides SSO using external identity exchange and authentication. |
| **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** | 📱 An authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0 that enables secure sign-in and single sign-on (SSO) to applications. |

### 📱 OpenID Connect (OIDC)
OIDC is an authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0 that provides:
- 🔒 Secure sign-in to applications.
- 🆔 ID token issuance, which allows a client to verify a user's identity.
- 👤 The **UserInfo endpoint**, an API that provides user profile details.

## 🏢 Claims-Based Identity in Microsoft Entra ID
When a user signs in, **Microsoft Entra ID** issues an **ID token** containing **claims** about the user.

### 🤔 What is a Claim?
A **claim** is a key-value pair that represents information about the user, such as an email address or username.

### ➡️ How Claims-Based Authentication Works:
1. ✅ User authentication occurs.
2. 📤 The Identity Provider issues an ID token with a set of claims.
3. ⚙️ The application processes the claims.
4. 🔓 The application grants access based on the claims.

## 🛡️ Security Tokens

Microsoft Entra ID issues **security tokens** to authorize access to resources. The three most common types of tokens are:

### 1. 🔑 **Access Token**
- Used to grant access to APIs and protected resources.
- Issued by an authorization server.
- Contains information about the user and the target resource.

### 2. 🔄 **Refresh Token**
- Used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
- Increases security by reducing the number of authentication prompts.

### 3. 🆔 **ID Token**
- Issued during OIDC authentication.
- Verifies the identity of the authenticated user.

## 🔏 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a compact and self-contained way to transmit authentication and authorization data. JWTs are **digitally signed** and contain three main parts:

### 📑 **1. Header (Algorithm & Token Type)**
Defines the signing algorithm and token type.

### 🧾 **2. Payload (Claims)**
Contains user identity and authorization details.

### ✍️ **3. Signature (Ensures Integrity)**
The **signature** is used to validate the authenticity of the JWT.

## 🚀 JWT Benefits:
- 🔒 Secure transmission of authentication details.
- 📦 Compact format, making them efficient for web and API authentication.
- 🖋️ Digitally signed to prevent tampering.

## 📖 Definitions in Claims-Based Identity

| Term         | Definition                                                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Claim**        | A key-value pair representing identity information.          |
| **Assertion**    | A data package (token) that shares identity details across security domains. |
| **Attribute**    | A key-value pair of data in a token.                        |
| **Augmentation** | The process of adding additional claims to a token for extra details. |
