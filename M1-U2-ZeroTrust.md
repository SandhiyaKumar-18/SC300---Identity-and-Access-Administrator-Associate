# 🔐 Exploring Zero Trust with Identity

## 📌 Overview
Organizations need a security model that **adapts to hybrid & multi-cloud environments**. Zero Trust is the solution—it assumes **no user or device is trusted by default**, requiring continuous verification before granting access.

---

## 🔍 Zero Trust Principles  
Zero Trust follows three core principles:

1️⃣ **Verify Explicitly** – Always authenticate users based on **identity, device health, and risk level**.  
2️⃣ **Use Least Privilege** – Grant **only necessary permissions** to limit access.  
3️⃣ **Assume Breach** – Protect systems **as if a breach has already occurred**, using encryption & monitoring.

## ⚡ Zero Trust Pillars  
Microsoft’s Zero Trust model secures six key areas:

| **Pillar**      | **Security Focus** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Identity**  | Strong authentication, MFA, passwordless login. |
| **Endpoints** | Enforce device compliance before access. |
| **Data**      | Encrypt & classify sensitive data. |
| **Apps**      | Conditional access & role-based permissions. |
| **Infrastructure** | Secure cloud & on-prem workloads. |
| **Network**   | Monitor for intrusions & segment traffic. |

🚀 **Key Focus: Identity Security**  
Identity defines the **Zero Trust control plane**. Every access request must be **verified using MFA, risk-based policies, and device security checks**.

## 🔍 Zero Trust Architecture  
A **layered security model** ensures real-time protection:

| **Layer** | **Security Feature** |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Policy Engine** | Evaluates **risk-based access requests** dynamically. |
| **IAM Solutions** | Manages authentication & authorization. |
| **Endpoint Protection** | Enforces **device security compliance**. |
| **Cloud Security** | Protects cloud workloads & applications. |
| **Networking Solutions** | Detects intrusions and **blocks unauthorized access**. |
| **SIEM & XDR Security** | AI-driven **threat detection & automated response**. |

📌 **Example:**  
A user logging in from an unknown device will trigger **an MFA prompt**. If **suspicious activity** is detected, access will be **blocked automatically**.

## 🚀 Why Zero Trust?  
✅ **Prevents unauthorized access & data breaches.**  
✅ **Enables secure remote work.**  
✅ **Uses AI to detect & respond to threats.**  
✅ **Ensures compliance with security policies.**
