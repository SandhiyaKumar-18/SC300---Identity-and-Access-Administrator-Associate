# 🔐 Identity and Access Management  

## 📌 Overview  
Identity is the foundation of access control and security. It ensures:  
✅ **Authentication** – Proving **who or what we are**  
✅ **Authorization** – Granting **permissions** based on roles  
✅ **Auditing** – Keeping track of **who did what, when, and where**  
✅ **Administration** – Managing **identities** efficiently

## 🔍 Key Aspects of Identity  

### **1️⃣ Authentication (AuthN) – Proving Identity**  
Authentication verifies **who you are** before granting access.  
- **Examples**: Passwords, MFA, biometrics, security keys  
- **Trusted sources** validate identity before allowing sign-in  
- Uses **federated protocols** (SSO, OAuth, OpenID, etc.)  

---

### **2️⃣ Authorization (AuthZ) – Granting Access**  
Authorization defines **what you can do** after authentication.  
- **Can a user access a resource?** – Enforced via permissions  
- **What actions are allowed?** – Based on roles & policies  
- **Applies business rules** – Such as **role-based (RBAC) & attribute-based (ABAC) access**  

---

### **3️⃣ Administration – Managing Identities**  
Identity administration simplifies access control and management.  
- **Single view management** – Centralized identity control  
- **Automated access approvals & assignments** – Reduces manual overhead  
- **Entitlement management** – Assigning roles & permissions efficiently  

---

### **4️⃣ Auditing – Monitoring & Compliance**  
Auditing ensures transparency & security by tracking actions.  
- **Who did what, when, and how?** – Logs all user activities  
- **Focused alerting** – Detect anomalies or suspicious access  
- **Governance & compliance** – Aligns with regulatory standards

## 🏢 What is an Identity Provider (IdP)?  
An **Identity Provider (IdP)** is a system that **creates, manages, and verifies identities**.  

### **Examples of IdPs**  
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**  
- **Okta, Google Identity, Ping Identity**  

### **Components of an IdP**  
- ✅ **User identity repository** – Stores user credentials  
- ✅ **Authentication system** – Verifies user identity  
- ✅ **Security protocols** – Prevents unauthorized access  
- ✅ **SSO & Trust Model** – Allows users to log in once and access multiple resources  

📌 **IdPs improve security & usability** by reducing password fatigue and enabling **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

## 🔄 Common Identity Protocols  

### **1️⃣ OpenID Connect (OIDC)**  
- **Authentication protocol built on OAuth2**  
- Issues **JSON identity tokens** via REST API  
- Used by many cloud services for **secure login**  

### **2️⃣ SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**  
- Open standard for **authentication & authorization**  
- XML-based **security assertions** enable access control  
- Used for **federated identity & SSO** in enterprises

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
🔹 Identity enables **authentication, authorization, auditing, and administration**.  
🔹 **Identity Providers (IdPs)** create & manage digital identities securely.  
🔹 **SSO & federated authentication** improve both **security & usability**.  
🔹 **Protocols like OpenID, OAuth2, & SAML** ensure safe authentication flows.
