# Configure and Manage Microsoft Entra Roles  

## Overview  
Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that helps organizations secure and manage access to resources. It is used for:  
- **External resources**: Microsoft 365, Azure portal, and SaaS applications.  
- **Internal resources**: Corporate network apps, intranet, and custom cloud applications.  

## **Who Uses Microsoft Entra ID?**  
### **1. IT Administrators**  
- Control access to applications and resources.  
- Enforce security policies like **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.  
- Automate user provisioning between **Windows Server AD** and cloud apps.  
- Protect user identities and credentials.  

### **2. App Developers**  
- Enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for applications.  
- Use APIs to integrate with organizational data.  

### **3. Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online Subscribers**  
- All tenants automatically use Microsoft Entra ID for access management.  

## **Microsoft Entra Roles**  
Roles in Microsoft Entra ID define what actions a user can perform, such as creating users, managing passwords, and assigning licenses.  

| **Role**                | **Permissions** | **Notes** |

### **Role Overlap Between Azure & Microsoft Entra ID**

- **Global Administrators** can enable **Access management for Azure resources** to assign Azure roles.  
- Some roles, like **Global Administrator**, span both **Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365**.  

## **Assigning Microsoft Entra Roles**  
### **Methods to Assign Roles**

   - **Azure portal** > **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Roles and administrators** > Select Role > **+ Add Assignment**.  
2. **Assign a broad-scope role (Subscription, Resource Group, Management Group)**:  
   - Use **Access control (IAM)** settings.  
3. **Assign roles using PowerShell or Microsoft Graph API**.  
4. **Use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time role elevation**.  

## **Example: Assigning a Role Using PIM**  
- If using **Microsoft Entra ID Premium P2**, all role assignments are managed via **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**.  
- Allows users to **elevate roles temporarily** when required.  

## **Creating Custom Roles in Microsoft Entra ID**
